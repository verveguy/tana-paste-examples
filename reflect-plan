For each file
	Change first line ‘# ‘ to be %%tana%% (no space)
	Append #day to end of first line
        TODO: Any other date conversion needed?
	For each line after the first
		Eliminate any empty lines that start with a -
            (These blow up Tana paste)
		Change any lines with ![] to be #missing_image ![]
            TODO: Anything better to do with images?
		For any line that starts with a 24:00 clock, append #meeting to the end (my habit)
